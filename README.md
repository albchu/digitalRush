# Lazer Cat Hero 

The year is 2175. Tensions in the south west pacific has inevitably caused the breakdown of all major governments across the globe. 
With all countries withdrawing frantically from joint country programs, the International Space Station gets evacuated so fast that
one fateful crew member has been left behind. Mylo the cat. 
A hyper intelligent experimental kitty held in the void of space for fear of his lazer eyes being used for nefarious means.

Suddenly while the earth turns its eyes away from the heavens, a field of astroids comes hurtling straight for earth. 
With no one else aware of the oncoming storm, 
Mylo must rise to the challenge and utilize all his cunning to defend the planet he longs to return to. 
Suffice it to say, the battle to come will have cat-astrophic circumstances.
